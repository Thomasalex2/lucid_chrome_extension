# Lucid Chrome Extension

Lucid is a Chrome Extension that replaces the traditional new tab screen with a soothing welcoming screen. It has a task view that encourages user to take action and has some quality of life features like random inspirational quote, new vocabulary and instant weather conditions.

The project is correctly under development and is set to introduce features later (see upcoming features list).

The project was made in React and [Momentum Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en) was the inspiration behind this project.

## Features

- Shows a welcoming screen with local time and date
- Ability to add tasks to focus for the session
    - Multiple tasks can be added in one go by separating the tasks by semicolon (;)
- Shows a random inspirational quote
- Shows a random new vocabulary (definition and usage appears when you hover over the new word)
- Shows the local weather condition (The app will request for your current location)
- Shows a random background image (if turned off, you will see a lovely gradient of colors cycling through the screen)
- Customizability - Any of the features mentioned above can be turned on/off at any point
